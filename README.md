## To Run Locally

- Make sure VS Code is installed
- Install the Live Server Extension in VS Code: [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
- Clone the Repo
- Open an HTML doc file and click the Open Preview button next to the Run Code Button
- Copy the local server URL to your browser of choice or use the built in VS code preview if preferred

This is how I have been running the frontend locally, if there is a better method please let me know.
